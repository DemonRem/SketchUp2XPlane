<h2>X-Plane plugin for SketchUp</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> is a free (as in beer) 3D object editor for Windows and MacOS.</p>
<p>This SketchUp plugin imports and exports models in X-Plane v8/v9/v10 <code>.obj</code> format.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Copy the files from the <code>.zip</code> archive into your SketchUp <code>Plugins</code> folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows: <code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Google\Google&nbsp;SketchUp&nbsp;<i>n</i>\Plugins</code></li>
  <li>Mac OS: <code>/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/Google&nbsp;SketchUp&nbsp;<i>n</i>/SketchUp/plugins</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(Re)start SketchUp.</p>
<p>You can now delete the <code>.zip</code> file that you downloaded. This help file can be viewed by choosing <samp>Help&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane</samp> in SketchUp.</p>

<h3>Creating X-Plane scenery objects</h3>
<p>Before you start, you can get a photo of the area that you're about to model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <samp>Window&nbsp;&rarr; Model&nbsp;Info&nbsp;&rarr; Geo-location&nbsp;&rarr; Add&nbsp;Location&#8230;</samp></li>
</ul>
<p>Create your model in SketchUp out of Rectangles, Circles and Arcs. Save the SketchUp <code>.skp</code> file in the aircraft or scenery folder where you want the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file to end up.</p>
<p>In an image editor application create one texture file that is like a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage" target="_blank">collage</a>" of all of the textures that you need in your model. The height and width of the texture file must be powers of two (<i>eg</i> 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048) but it doesn't have to be square. Save the texture file in 32 bit or 24 bit PNG format (<i>ie</i> with or without an "Alpha" channel) in the aircraft or scenery folder where you want the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file to end up.</p>
<p>Use the <samp>Paint Bucket</samp> tool to apply your one texture file to every face in your model. Use <samp>Context&nbsp;menu&nbsp;&rarr; Texture&nbsp;&rarr; Position</samp>
to map the correct portion of this texture file to each face.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHsRRLCAOm8" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial for how to position a texture on a curved surface. Or you can enable <samp>View&nbsp;&rarr; Hidden&nbsp;Geometry</samp> and then select one face of the surface at a time and position the texture on each face.</p>
<p>If you want both sides of a face to be displayed in X-Plane then apply the <samp>Paint Bucket</samp> tool twice; once on each side of the face. You can use the <samp>Window&nbsp;&rarr; Entity&nbsp;Info</samp> panel to see which texture(s) are currently assigned to the two sides of the currently selected face.</p>
<p>You can use <samp>Tools&nbsp;&rarr; Highlight&nbsp;Untextured</samp> to help you with texturing. This doesn't change how your model will appear in X-Plane, but it does highlight in SketchUp any problems with your texturing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Untextured faces are coloured red. This helps you to identify these faces.</li>
  <li>For faces that are textured on just one side, the other side is hidden (by setting the opacity to 0). This helps you see if you've textured the wrong side of any faces. Use <samp>Context&nbsp;menu&nbsp;&rarr; Reverse&nbsp;Faces</samp> on the face if you have.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>This plugin adds three entries to the context menu. These can be used when you have a face selected:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><samp>Hard</samp></dt>
  <dd>Controls whether aircraft can land on and/or collide with this face in X-Plane.<br>
Making faces "hard" is expensive so use this sparingly. Vertical "hard" faces don't work as you might expect; if you want to make a building collidable just use this button on the roof, not on the sides.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><samp>Ground</samp></dt>
  <dd>Controls whether the face is rendered with "polygon offsetting" in X-Plane.<br>
Use this on faces that lie flat on the ground to prevent Z-buffer thrashing in X-Plane. Don't press this button for other faces.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><samp>Alpha</samp></dt>
  <dd>This is a hint to X-Plane that the face is textured with a partially or wholly transparent or translucent texture.<br>
Use this on any transparent or translucent faces through which you want to see other faces from the same model. Don't press this button for opaque (normal) faces.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Exporting to X-Plane</h3>
<p>If you have not already done so, choose <samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Save&nbsp;As&#8230;</samp> and save the <code>.skp</code> file in the aircraft or scenery folder where you want the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file to end up.</p>
<p>If you have loaded a terrain photo from Google Earth then you need to hide it before exporting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <samp>Window&nbsp;&rarr; Layers</samp>.</li>
  <li>In the <samp>Layers</samp> panel ensure that "Google Earth Terrain" and "Google Earth Snapshot" are both unchecked.</li>
  <li>If you loaded the terrain photo before you started modelling then you can read the co-ordinates where your model should be placed in X-Plane from the <samp>Window&nbsp;&rarr; Model&nbsp;Info&nbsp;&rarr; Geo-location</samp> panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Export&nbsp;X-Plane&nbsp;Object</samp></li>
</ul>
<p>The object is created in the same folder and with the same name as the current SketchUp file, but with a <code>.obj</code> extension. If your model containes embedded textures (for example if it was downloaded from Google 3D Warehouse) then copies of these textures are created in the same folder.</p>
<p>You may see the following warnings:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Warning: You used multiple texture files. Using file <i>name</i>.</dt>
  <dd>You used more than one texture file to texture the faces in your model.<br>
X-Plane requires that you use only one texture file for all of your faces.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Warning: <i>n</i> faces are untextured.</dt>
  <dd>You have not applied a texture to all of the faces in your SketchUp model.<br>
X-Plane will colour the untextured faces with the bottom left pixel from your texture file (or grey if you have not applied a texture to any of the faces).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you see either warning then X-Plane probably won't display your model as you intended.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Construct your SketchUp model out of Rectangles, Circles, Arcs, Components and Groups only - any other SketchUp types are not exported.</p>
<p>This plugin does not allow you to create advanced X-Plane scenery primitives, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Animations</li>
  <li>Attributes: <i>eg</i> cockpit, materials etc</li>
  <li>Level Of Detail</li>
  <li>Lights, Lines and Smoke</li>
</ul>
